## ðŸ“Š Tableau Dashboard

To better visualize the insights derived from the SQL analysis, Iâ€™ve built a **clean and interactive Tableau dashboard** hosted on Tableau Public. The dashboard focuses on key attrition indicators such as education level, company type, city development index, and training hours.
